# 🛑 Save Point Plugin

## Overview

The **Save Point Plugin** for IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful tool that I've developed to help you create and manage snapshots of your project. Whether you're experimenting with new features or just want a secure fallback option, this plugin makes it easy to roll back to previous project states.

<!-- Plugin description -->
The Save Point Plugin enhances project management by allowing developers to create, view, and manage save points within their projects. Key features include:
- Adding custom save points with unique names and descriptions.
- Rolling back to any previously created save point.
- Undoing the most recent rollback operation.
- Deleting save points that are no longer needed.
- Viewing and managing all save points through an intuitive tool window interface.
- Automatic refresh of the IDE to reflect changes immediately.
