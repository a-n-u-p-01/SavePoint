## Features

- **Note**:Before Add Save Point / Commit, save(Ctrl + s) the file first may be auto save not work some time

- **Add**: Create a new save point with a unique name and message. Frequent addition of save points can clutter your project; consider using naming conventions to keep them organized. 

- **Remove**: Delete an existing save point. This action is irreversible, so ensure the save point is no longer needed before deletion.

- **Save Points**: View all added save points in the project. Ensure save points are accurately named to avoid confusion.

- **Rollback**: Revert the project to a previously created save point. Rollback may overwrite current changes, so make sure to commit or save your work before performing this action.

- **Undo Rollback**: Revert the most recent rollback operation. This restores the project to the state before the last rollback. Use this feature cautiously to avoid unintended data loss.

- **Commit**: Save changes to the current save point. This updates the save point with new changes. Verify that the save point reflects the desired state of the project before committing.

- **Path**: Specify the path to the save point location. Incorrect path configuration may result in failed operations, so ensure the path settings are accurate.

- **Refresh**: Update the tool window to reflect the latest save points and changes. Refreshing ensures that all save point data is current. Use this feature to synchronize the tool window with recent updates.
